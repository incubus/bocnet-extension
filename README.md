# BOCNET access

This Chrome extension provides you a limited access to the personal banking system
of Bank of China (中国银行).

It is based on the work and ideas from [np-activex project](http://code.google.com/p/np-activex/) and [Tianji Wu](http://www.wutj.info/prj-userscript-bundle)

Any help is welcome!
